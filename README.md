- First 'real' project in which I applied these techniques:
	- functional-style programming
	- working with localStorage and sessionStorage browser APIs (over multiple pages)
  - usage of Map and Set object types
	
- Automated the work-flow for the request creation - as a workaround until real implementation in Snow admin role
	- Reduced the number of clicks per request-type ticket
		-- from 46 to 4
	- Reduced the number of copy-pastes repetitiveness to 0
	
- New interactions (new tickets) auto-refresh queue and toast notification alert system - hopefully as a workaround until real implementation in Snow admin role
	
- System sleep disable mode, if needed

- Tie-in for the telephony/timetracker webapp intermittent disconection issues
	-- Toast notification for unwanted Logoff incident
